# TSIA201 - Travaux Pratiques

Welcome to the practical work repository for the TSIA201 course. This repository contains two practical works (TP) completed by Maël Le Guillouzic.

## General Instructions

- **Re-run the notebooks**: Due to size constraints, the notebooks need to be re-executed to visualize the results.
- **Images**: Images should be placed in the same folder as the corresponding notebook to be displayed correctly.
- **Language**: The practical works are written in French.

## TP1: Conversion of Sampling Rate and STFT

### Introduction
This practical work aims to carry out filtering in a multirate system (with an application to the conver-
sion of sampling rate), and to understand and implement a perfect reconstruction filter bank for audio
equalization. The files related to this practical work are available on the eCampus website of the teaching
unit.

## TP2: Wavelets

### Introduction
In this TP, we will work on some fundamental concepts in Wavelets and compression of images.

First we'll briefly check the limitations of the Fourier transform. We'll then check some fundamental properties of a family of Wavelets and compute the Wavelet transform of a very simple signal. In the second part of the TP, we will use the DWT to compress and image.
